This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

> Note: This project uses Next.js 16 which requires Node.js `>= 20.9.0`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Static Hosting (out/)

This project is configured for static export.

1. Build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Upload the generated `out/` folder to your static hosting provider.

**Preview locally**

```bash
npm run preview
```

**Deploying under a subpath (optional)**

If your hosting serves the site under a subpath (example: `https://domain.com/polimnia`), build with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/polimnia npm run build
```
